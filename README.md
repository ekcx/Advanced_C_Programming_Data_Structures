# Advanced_C_Programming_Data_Structures
I am developing advanced topics of C programming library and codes.

Dynamic Memory Allocation, Linked Lists, Structure, Stack, Heap, Queue are related terms for C programming language. Such topics require strong knowledge and implementing ability.
I will represent my C programming language skills by using these Data Structure topics by following book "Problem Solving and Computation for Scientists and Engineers: An Introduction Using C, Steven Lerman"

After getting some distances on this project, I am planning to use Valgrind to analyze the Memory Condition of a written code. The memory leakage of the written program can be analyzed by using Valgrind.
The another reason of to use Valgrind that it can show how effective of the code and effect on the memory of the programme.
